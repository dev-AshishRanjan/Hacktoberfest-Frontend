            Food for Life is a food donation program initiated by Parivartan in 2023.The program aims to provide nutritious meals to people who are struggling to meet their basic needs due to poverty, illness, or any other adverse circumstances.

The program operates by collecting surplus food from hotels, restaurants, and other sources, and distributing it to the needy through a network of volunteers. The food is carefully selected to ensure that it is fresh, healthy, and safe for consumption. Volunteers of the program work tirelessly to collect, sort, and distribute the food to the beneficiaries.

Food for Life is not just a means of providing meals to the underprivileged but is also an initiative that fosters social responsibility and encourages people to reduce food wastage. The program emphasizes the importance of sharing and caring for others, and it has positively impacted the lives of many people in need.
